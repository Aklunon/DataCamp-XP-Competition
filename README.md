üí™ Challenge
Create a report to answer the principal's questions. Include:

What are the top 5 countries with the highest internet use (by population share)?
How many people had internet access in those countries in 2019?
What are the top 5 countries with the highest internet use for each of the following regions: 'Middle East & North Africa', 'Latin America & Caribbean', 'East Asia & Pacific', 'South Asia', 'North America', 'Europe & Central Asia'?
Create a visualization for those five regions' internet usage over time.
What are the 5 countries with the most internet users?
What is the correlation between internet usage (population share) and broadband subscriptions for 2019?
Summarize your findings.
Note: This is how the World Bank defines the different regions.
